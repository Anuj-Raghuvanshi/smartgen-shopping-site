					We work in a very wide range of industries and the skills required are likewise variable. These range from basic circuit theory to the management skills required of project manager. The tools and equipment that an individual engineer may need are similarly variable, ranging from a simple voltmeter to a top end analyzer to sophisticated design and manufacturing software.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the electrical systems become more sophisticated, so must the skills of the electrical maintenance technician. By mixing the theoretical with practical hands-on lab experiences using modern up-to-date industrial equipment and techniques, the student will be prepared for a challenging career in electrical maintenance.

					Electrical losses continue to top the list as the equipment category with the most premature breakdowns. An effective Electrical Preventive Maintenance (EPM) program will go a long way to help avoid the extra expense, disruptions and lost profits that can result. Yet, it may seem overwhelming for many businesses to develop, implement and follow up on an EPM program. This article is designed to provide information and recommendations that will help you move ahead.

					In our competitive business environment, with just in time delivery systems and maximized productivity, facility up time is not only critical to business continuation, but to maintaining a leadership position in your market. Over the past two decades we have seen alarming increases in frequency and severity of electrical system failures. Estimates on the annual costs to industry from power related anomalies have ranged from $30 billion to $200 billion. When an electrical system malfunctions, it is not only expensive to make repairs, but can be a disaster in terms of fire loss as well. Electrical system malfunctions are the leading cause of fire in commercial buildings.
